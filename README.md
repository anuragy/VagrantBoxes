# VagrantBoxes <br/>
<br/>
This project has three purposes: <br/>
1 - To create VMs using Vagrant + Virtual Box <br/>
2 - Provision all VMs through Ansible <br/>
3 - Deploy a sample webapp on Tomcat (which can be picked up from staging.d directory) <br/>
<br/>
Though it works but needs little cleanup! <br/>
